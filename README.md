# terraform_assignment
**Write a Terraform script to create a custom VPC and deploy two EC2 VMs on AWS using Terraform. The code should be broken into three different parts:**

1. **Networking**: Define the VPC and all of its components.
2. **SSH-Key**: Dynamically create an SSH key pair for connecting to VMs.
3. **EC2**: Deploy a VM in the public subnet and deploy another VM in a private subnet.
4. **NGINX**: Ensure NGINX is installed and accessible from the internet on the public VM.
5. **Automate Terraform Deployment**: Use Jenkins Pipelines to automate the deployment process.
